# Mannequin Images

This directory contains placeholder images for the rotating mannequin animation in the registration forms.

## Required Images

For the animation to work properly, you need to replace these placeholder files with actual mannequin images:

1. `mannequin-back.png` - Back view of a male mannequin
2. `mannequin-back-angle.png` - Back-angle view (45° from back)
3. `mannequin-side.png` - Side view (90° from back)
4. `mannequin-front-angle.png` - Front-angle view (45° from front)
5. `mannequin-front.png` - Front view of the mannequin

## Image Requirements

- All images should have transparent backgrounds (PNG format recommended)
- Images should be of consistent size and scale
- Recommended dimensions: at least 500px width, with appropriate height to maintain proportions
- The mannequin should be centered in each image

## Animation Behavior

As users fill out the registration form, the mannequin will rotate from the back view to the front view, providing visual feedback on form completion progress.
